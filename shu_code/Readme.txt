This is a code script used to verify SHU Dataset.
Researcher will download the dataset first, and save all the files of the dataset in ./or_data/.
The script includes three classification methods of ws, cs, and csa. Among them, ws includes CSP, FBCSP and FBCNet toolbox. The FBCNet toolbox contains three deep learning algorithms: FBCNet, eegNet, and deepConvNet.
In cs, the FBCNet framework is used to implement cross-session classification of three deep learning algorithms FBCNet, eegNet, and deepConvNet.
Cross-session adaptation is included in csa.
The Readme.txt in each algorithm describes the basic usage of the script.
If an error is reported during program execution, please check the running path. It is recommended that users open the algorithm path to run.
