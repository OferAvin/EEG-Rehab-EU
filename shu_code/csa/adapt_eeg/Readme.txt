Users need to run './preprocess_h5_shu.py' to prepare data for adapt eeg toolbox. Users need to down load the models in github named 'model_f0' to 'model_f24' and save them in './models'. Then run './train_base.py' to train models for each subject. 
You can run 'train_adapt.py' to test the cross-session adaptation results. Here you can select your own models from base training or use the exist model we have trained before. And in train_adapt.py you can choose 'trXlen' and 'ValXlen' to set the adaptive ratio.
Before running 'train_adapt.py', you need to configure three parameters. The first parameter represents the dataset file path, and the input is 'data/SHU_data.h5'. The second parameter represents the model path, and the input is 'models'. The third parameter represents the results save path, and the input is 'results'.
